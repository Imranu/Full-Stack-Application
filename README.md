Spring Project

Dependencies Include:

flyway-core,
postgresql

Java Version 17

1) Removed templates folder from resources becuase I plan on using react.js therefore there is no need for a template engine.
2) Currently spring jdbc is commented out on the pom so we can run application till we have set up the database.
3) Created a react js application.
